# Theaterpedia-Core: Portal

This will become the default portals-template for usage whilst actively developing on the layers for theaterpedia.
This template mocks a simple Portal that collects data of several websites and presents them in galleries. It will provide a shopping-cart/checkout-functionality for some of the items.

The data-model, dev-process and logic is documented along the tests in apps/portal/tests

Look at the [Theaterpedia documentation](https://docs.theaterpedia.org/) to learn more.
